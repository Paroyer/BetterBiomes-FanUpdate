# Better Biomes - FanUpdate
 Updated version of BetterBiomes by Julyuary/ParanormalVibe to the last version of the CWSDK (7.1 atm). Will be updated to the next version of the SDK until Julyuary come back dont worry!
 
 Original work by Julyuary, link to his github (CWSDK-6.1):

*If ever you use any other mods from Julyuary on Nexus, like weaponXP, BrightNights and BetterProgression, those are actually wrap up of other people .cwmod. Back then there was no native support from the modloader so that was usefull maybe a couple months, but now it's causing more harm than any good. You just have to drop the .cwmod alongside any other mod you're using in the /Mods folder. If you need a download link for any of those .cwmod look up in the Posts section of their respective Nexus page I commented all necessary links*
